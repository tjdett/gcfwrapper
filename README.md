This is a tiny project for forcing [Google Chrome Frame](http://www.google.com/chromeframe/) to be active for a particular website. It was originally written to allow IE8 users to look at modern HTML5 websites.

It's not a robust solution for dealing with old browsers, but for sending example links to people with 4+ year old browsers, it's better than nothing.
